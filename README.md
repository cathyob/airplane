## Airplane Seating Chart

This was created to exercise a webcall and multiple sorts.

The given array of seats could be in any order.

It is assumed that all rows in a section are the same e.g. all rows in first class have two seats, an aisle, then two more seats.

Aisles are not provided and must be determined based on what seat number(s) are missing.

The sections should show in order of row number e.g. the original array may have the first seat as an economy class but both first and business class should be shown before economy.

Blue = Available
White = Unavailable
Pink = Selected

The user should be able to select one of the available seats. If another seat is already selected it should be deselected.
